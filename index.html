        Hi, my Name is Salvatore Argentieri! I'm 25 years old, and recently left a 10 year stint in the service industry to pursue my life long goal of having a career in a STEM related field. I believe that the Full Stack Development program at SMU CAPE will be the jump start I need into my new career.

        I currently live in the heart of Dallas with my amazing girlfriend, Madeleine, and my two cats: Esteban, and Luna. I absolutely love living in Dallas. I live literally five minutes most neighborhoods, which allows us to explore the best of what the city has to offer. My girlfriend and I consider ourselves foodies, so if you ever need a recommendation of whats hot in Dallas be sure to let me know!

        My favorite food right now is the Pork Mazemen Ramen from Ten Ramen (best ramen in Texas, change my mind). My favorite cocktail is a Naked and Famous, which uses Mezcal as its primary component. I've been on an agave spirit kick, so if its not made with blue agave I simply won't drink it. My favorite agave spirit right now is Mezcal (Casamigos has great, approachable Mezcal FYI)!
